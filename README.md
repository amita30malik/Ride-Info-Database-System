This project is a ride-booking database system built using PostgreSQL to efficiently manage users, drivers, and rides. It includes structured tables with constraints for data integrity, such as phone number validation and unique emails. A PL/pgSQL function dynamically assigns available drivers to rides, updating their status in real time. The system supports CRUD operations,ensuring smooth ride requests, tracking, and driver management. Additionally, Mockaroo was used for generating test data. This project enhances ride allocation efficiency while maintaining structured data storage.
